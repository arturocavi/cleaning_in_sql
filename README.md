# Data Cleaning in SQL
Cleaning Data in SQL Queries in PostgreSQL and SQL Server.

## Overview
I transformed raw housing data in SQL to make it more usable for analysis.\
I made two versions, one in SQL Server and other one in PostgreSQL.\
For the PostgreSQL version I created a table in SQL and then I copied some CSV files to it, while in SQL Server I upload them through the Import Flat File Wizard.
